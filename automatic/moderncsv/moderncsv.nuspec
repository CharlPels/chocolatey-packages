### View Large CSV Files Quickly
* Modern CSV is not only a powerful CSV editor, it’s also a power CSV viewer. It comes with a read-only mode that loads large files quickly and with a small memory footprint just a fraction of the file size. In fact, it can load up to 11 times faster than Excel. Furthermore, Excel can only read about 1 million rows. Modern CSV can read billions.
